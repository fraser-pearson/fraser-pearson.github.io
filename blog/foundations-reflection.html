<h2>Reflection</h2>

<h4>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h4>
<ul>
    <li>I tend to not take in too much of other people's opinions. I like the way I do things so it's sometimes hard to adjust to other people.</li>
    <li>I tend to forget about myself when I'm studying. I only focus of the tasks I need to complete rather than taking care of myself</li>
    <li>I need to be confident in my own work and knowledge.</li>
  </ul> 

<h4>What are the roles of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
<p>
    Values, empathy and self-awareness are all important when learning and programming.
     You are going to need to be intact and learn from other people so knowing how these concepts effect is important.
</p>

<h4>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h4>
<p>
    How much of it is focused on improving how you think and manage yourself. I didnâ€™t think core was going to be on increasing your social and mental skills rather than your technical
</p>

<h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
<p>
    Core learning is hard for me because I have always struggled talking about myself and thinking about my own skill set.
     I find it hard to find what values and beliefs are important to me.
</p>

<h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h4>
<p>
    Core learning is about keeping the balance of study and social learning.
     It's important to improve our technical skills but it's also needed to improve our social ones.
      We need these skills in programming so we will likely be working as a team.
</p>

<h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time?
     Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
<p>
    It does feel a little waste of time but I understand the need of core learning and why it is needed.
     We programmers need to be able to take care of ourselves and others when we are doing our jobs.
      We will be working closely with others coding so knowing how to act and improve ourselves in social situations is important.
