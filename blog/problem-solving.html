<h2>Problem Solving</h2>

<h4>
    What was the problem?
</h4>
<p>
    I was failing to get the SuperFizzBuzz program to work. It was meant to take a list of number and output fizz if it was divisible by 3,
     buzz if by 5 and fizzbuzz if by both.
</p>

<h4>
    What problem-solving techniques did you use?
</h4>
<p>
    The problem solving techniques I used were mainly console.logging and reading error messages.
     I used the console.I used the techniques to find where the issue was occurring and from there it was easy enough to fix the code.
</p>

<h4>
    How did you feel throughout the process?
</h4>
<p>
    I did not feel bad throughout the process. I never felt like I wouldnt be able to find a solution in a reasonable amount of time.
     I knew what I needed to do was just pushing through it now.
</p>

<h4>
    What did you learn?
</h4>
<p>
    I learned the importance of using console.log to see what your code outputs and see what different error messages mean. 
</p>

<h4>
    elegantly solved a problem.
</h4>
<h4>
    What was the problem?
</h4>
<p>
    With the Built in Methods challenge I had an issue getting the capitalize function to work. Basically make sure a sentence starts with a capital letter. 
</p>

<h4>
    What problem-solving techniques did you use?
</h4>
<p>
    Pseudocode was used to get the order of what I needed to do and when.
     Console.log was used if my code was actually doing what I wanted. Lastly I used google to see how certain methods worked like array.map.
</p>

<h4>
    How did you feel throughout the process?
</h4>
<p>
    It was a little frustrating as sometimes the code was not working how I thought it would but using the techniques 
    I knew what parts were the issues and I never thought I wouldnt be able to do it.
</p>

<h4>
    What did you learn?
</h4>
<p>
    The use of sites like msn and w3school have good information on coding methods and with a quick google search you can find out how they work.
</p>

<h4>
    Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:
</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>1</strong>:  Very bad</li>
    <li><strong>2</strong>:  Bad</li>
    <li><strong>3</strong>:  Moderate</li>
    <li><strong>4</strong>:  Good</li>
    <li><strong>5</strong>:  Very Good</li>
</ul>
