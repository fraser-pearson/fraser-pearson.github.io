<h4>
    Research Growth Mindset
</h4>
<h4>
    Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
</h4>
<p>
    Having a Growth Mindset is the idea of constantly improving yourself and not sagnating.
     Compared to a fixed mindset you will push through failure to see success later one,
      you will put effort in learning new skills and you take feedback to improve yourself.
       It's relevant as when learning anything you should have a good growth mindset,
        it's ok to fail or struggle to understand something you are doing this to improve yourself for the future.
</p>

<h4>
    In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
</h4>
<p>
    I found researching the growth mindset quite interesting although I don't believe anything changed for me.
     I already had a growth mindset so I have been always thinking ahead knowing that my learning will be helpful
      in the future and it will take effort to achieve this goal.
</p>

<h4>
    How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?
</h4>
<p>
    On my learning journey I will think about a growth mindset if I come across a wall.
     I know it may take effort to overcome it but it will be worth it for the future.
      I know this learning journey wont be a walk in the park and I will have to be motivated to complete it.

<h4>
    Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
</h4>
<p>
    With my learning plan it's important to have a growth mindset but it's also important you don't
     forget to relax and care about your other commitments than study.I want to become a full stack developer
      so I know I need the training to improve myself but I should forget about my social and mental health while doing it.
