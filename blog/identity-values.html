<h2>Identity and Values</h2>
<br>
<h4>
    Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and the consequences of your action.
</h4>
<p>
    I can't think of any major life changing ethical decision I've personally made in my life but a minor one would be getting into an argument with someone being anti-vaccine. I went into that conversation knowing I was probably going to get nowhere but I was kind and understanding of their situation. I told them the facts while being as nice and kind as possible. It ended with them saying they hadn’t changed their mind and still are concerned about getting it. While I could've been forceful and said horrible things to scare them into getting it or got angry at them. It wouldn’t have been a really ethical way of dealing with it. The consequences of this action cause them to come out of this conversation without any hostility as I was caring when I spoke to them. If I had been loud and aggressive they wouldn’t have taken the message seriously and just been mad at me.
</p>
<p>
    Most people say that I'm shy and tend to avoid situations that may cause confrontation. The feedback from people I get normally says that I should be more assertive and confident. They say that I am hard working and kind but need to speak up to get my point across.
</p>

<h4>
    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
</h4>
<p>
    My Dad is a kiwi and my mum is chinese. My mum hasn’t kept most of her culture as she was born in NZ and wasn’t forced to learn Chinese traditions. With my parents they never forced any type of traditional culture onto me so I have taken on that kiwi culture. I was born In NZ and stayed here my whole life so the kiwi lifestyle is basically all I know. 
</p>
<p>
    The ways this culture has influenced my values and identity. We kiwi’s are pretty laid back and like to help our people when they are in need. Some values I have gained from this is being caring. This means for me being nice towards others and taking other people's situations into account. This also goes into being tolerant with others, you never know what people are going through so it's always best to to not start being offensive if it's possible.I’m also someone who likes to think about something before taking action so I can do the best possible action before making something worse.
</p>
<p>
    E kore a muri e hokia
</p>
<p>
    What is done is done: What I take from this proverb is that you should not focus so much on the past instead if you take the mistakes you made and move past them to focus on the present. Mistakes are bound to happen and it's pointless to waste time thinking about them. This shows where I get that laid back attitude from, as long as I can continue to push followed I know I can make some mistakes.
</p>

<h4>
    Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
</h4>
<p>
    Some of my core strengths involved in the learning process are. Being Motivated, I am always willing to learn new things and learning how to
    code is something I’m really interested in. Being motivated means to me that I’m actually enjoying and want to continue what I’m doing.
    Open-minded, meaning to consider all possibilities without automatically dismissing them without a reason. Analytical,
    meaning I like to think about an action before doing something. These are just some of my strengths that are associated with my 
    learning.
</p>
<p>
    Some limitations I have in the learning process are.l like to take my time to fully learn something before moving on. 
    This can make me quite slow at completing tasks. It's a little outside my comfort zone to work with large teams. 
    While small teams are fine it's when there are like 20 or so people that communication starts to break down. 
    Under time restraints I tend to make more errors and skip over things. If I start rushing my ability to learn the topic takes a hit and
     I tend to remember what I learnt far less.
</p>

<h4>
    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they intersect with learning obstacles.
</h4>
<p>
    My strengths of being motivated and being dedicated intersects quite well with my learning obstacle of time management / procrastination. 
    While I am motivated to do the work I have issues with balancing time and also tend to procrastinate the hardest parts for last. 
    I will get through the work in time. It might be either the end of rushing the start or the end of the project though. 
    Another one is being analytical. This can stop me from rushing through something and stop and think about it potentially getting the
    task done to a higher quality.
</p>

<h4>
    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others,
    but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time,
    how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
</h4>
<p>
    An example in the past was when I was working as a team during my study at EIT. 
    Most of our team worked well together but one person was absent most days and did basically no work. 
    He would not complete an equal share of the work and wasn’t coming to any of the meetings. 
    The strategies we employed were compromised with him to get him to at least make him do some work. 
    He ended up doing the bare minimum so it wasn’t that effective. 
    We ended up having enough of it and getting the teacher to basically kick him out of our group.
    We were trying to be as nice and thoughtful as possible but realistically we should have been more firm from the start.
    Next time with that situation I would not let it go on for so long and while still being understanding of their situation be still firm
    about what needs to be done.
</p>
<p>
    He waka eke noa
</p>
<p>
    A canoe which we are all in with no exception. What I take from this proverb is that we are all in this together and when there 
    is someone in need we should help them. My situation I believe I tried to help them as much as possible but If they are unwilling 
    to try there is nothing you can do.
