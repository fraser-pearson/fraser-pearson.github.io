<h2>
    Javascript DOM
</h2>
<h4>
    An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS
</h4>
<p>
    If we imagine a car HTML is the base elements of the car like the wheels, frame, windows. 
    CSS is making those elements look nice, added a paint job, and nice leather seats. 
    Javascript is used to add functionality and more complex interactable actions to the website.
     This would be like making the steering wheel actually turn the car or making the windows wine down.
</p>

<h4>
    Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example, 
    'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth' (but not those).
</h4>
<p>
    Control flow is how the computer sees and runs the code. For javascript the code is read from top to bottom. 
    This means you need to write your code before calling for it. For example you can call a function before it is interized earlier.
</p>
<p>
    An example of this in your daily life would be tying your shoe. 
    Control flow means that you have an order of doing things you would not start by doing your laces without first putting your foot in the shoe.
</p>
<p>
    Loops are an important basic element of javascript. 
    They are used when you are needing to go through something multiple times. For example looping through an array or object. 
    Setting different parameters can be used to change how the loop functions.
</p>
<p>
    Using the example of tying your shoes an example of a loop could be for each hole to pull your lace through. 
    This would be more efficient than writing code to do each individual hole.

<h4>
    Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
</h4>
<p>
    DOM or Document Object Model is an interface that tells how a browser should interpret the code that it is reading. 
    It basically used to change the code into the actual page that you design, it gives you the normal web browsing experience.
</p>
<p>
    To interact with the DOM we can use javascript to locate and change elements of html and give them new properties. 
    For example grabbing a html element by its class name and changing its color. This is interacted with by the use of a click.
</p>

<h4>
    Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.
</h4>
<p>
    Arrays are basically a list of things you can access by using an index number for example [0]. This grabs the for thing inside the array.
     [1] would be the second thing in the array and so on. Something like a shopping list would be a good array as you only care about the names of your groceries 
     and it's easy to put new names in and out of the array.
</p>

<p>
    Objects are similar to arrays but a little more complex as they are used to store things but just in a different way. 
    You can get a thing out of an object by using a key that is assigned to the object. For example a client object could have their name, email as a key. 
    Objects are useful when you want to create a lot of things that will contain other things, like making a bunch of clients that contain their creditidenials.
</p>

<h4>
    Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
</h4>
<p>
    Functions are used to simplify your code and not repeat it all over the place. 
    Functions are blocks of code that can be called upon easily used a initiation command for example, myfunction() 
    If you want to do something more than once in code you will make a function instead of writing it twice. 
    Then you can call it as many times as you want.
