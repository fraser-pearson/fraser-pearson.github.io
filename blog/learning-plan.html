<h2>Learning Plan</h2>
<br>
<h4>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
<p>
    Full stack developer. Being able to produce websites and applications 
</p>

<h4>
    A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
</h4>
<p>
    My strengths when It comes to learning is my dedication and open-mind. 
    Being dedicated means to me to be able to put the time into something to get it done.
     Open-minded is being open to learning new thing and not avoiding learning hard or difficult task
</p>

<h4>
    What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy
</h4>
<p>Skills I would like to work on are communication and being more confident. 
    Communication is a needed skill in any job and in general it's been a skill that I've been lacking since I like to keep to myself.
     Being confident is just being more open about myself and my knowledge.
</p>

<h4>
    A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:
</h4>
<p>
    I plan to manage my learning by doing the study to a schedule of generally 6-8 hours a day. 
    I don't want to have a lot of work due near the end of the week so I will normally try to get the work done early.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    If things start to build up and I start having issues I will reach out to one of our teachers to ask what can be done. 
    It's important for me not to forget about personal life situations when studying and reach out if there's a problem.
</p>

<h4>
    A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
</h4>
<p>
    The main way I will seek help is using the dev-academy discord as that seems to be the most active place to go to. 
    Help can be both from other students and teachers. It doesn't matter as long as the problem is resolved.
</p>

<h4>
    A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team
</h4>
<p>
    I expect the facilitation team to help with any problem that occurs about the dev academy course. 
    The team should respond to questions and issues in a quick and routine manner. 
    Any changes or potential issues that affect  students, the students should be notified and given enough time to deal with them.
</p>

<h4>
    Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, 
    you might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.
</h4>
<p>
    The only commitment I have currently that will affect my schedule is a 8:45am to 9am daily meeting with work to see 
    how progress on the dev academy course is going.
