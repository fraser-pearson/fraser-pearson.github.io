            <h2>Blog 1: What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning</h2>
            <br>
            <p>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4>Css positioning</h4>
            <br>
            <p>  
                Relative positioning changes the position relative to where it normally appears in the html order. 
                you can change a relative position by using top, bottom, right and left css to move elements in a direction 
                by that amount. This still keeps the element in the normal flow of positioning.
            </p>
                
                <img class="positingpic" src="../images/Relative.png" alt="Relative">

            <p> 
                Fixed position a set to a location in the viewport and will not move when the page is scrolled. 
                This means you can scroll on the website and the element won't change its position on your screen.
            </p>

                <img class="positingpic" src="../images/Fixed.png" alt="Fixed">
            <p>   
                Absolute position is removed from the normal flow and has no positioned ancestors. 
                This means you can have elements that overlap and other elements do not affect the positing of the absolute element. 
            </p> 
                <img class="positingpic" src="../images/Absolute.png" alt="Absolute">
            <p>
                Positioning can be rather difficult and there is no one way to do something. 
                It depends on the situation for what positioning you should use. 
                They all serve a different purpose and you are likely to use all of them to create your website.
