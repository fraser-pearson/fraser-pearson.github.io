    Emotional Intelligence

<h4>
    What is Emotional Intelligence?
</h4>
<p>
    Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage one emotion, perceive others and express oneself. 
    EQ focuses on how well you can connect to others and how well you are able to deal with your emotions. 
    This is important as EQ is how you interact with the world and how you can manage your problems. Without good EQ you will get issues with not being able to deal with your emotional problems that may occur. EQ can be hard to test but can be done by using a self-report test or an ability test. Self-reports are done by answering questions by rating their own behaviors. Ability tests are done by having other people assess their skills by making them demonstrate in situations.
</p>

<h4>
    How is it different from IQ?
</h4>
<p>
    Intelligence quotient is the measure of how well someone can solve puzzles or retrieve knowledge and recall it. 
    IQ is the ability to deal with problem solving skills and more technical skills. 
    EQ focuses on the emotional side of a person and IQ is the technical skills side of them.
</p>

<h4>
    Why is it important?
</h4>
<p>
    EQ and IQ are important to everyone. A low EQ means it will be harder for someone to deal with their emotions and may need additional help. 
    They may need more time and more support than you would expect normally. IQ is important as it is your ability to problem solve. 
    Having it low means it may take a person longer to learn new things. It's important to make sure you are able to provide them with the necessary tools and provide them with enough time to allow them to succeed.
